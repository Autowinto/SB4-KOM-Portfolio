\section{Analysis}
Analysis describes only *what* the system should do and not *how* it is done.
In analysis, you can come up with a rough draft of the interfaces and the entities of the game.
Furthermore, you should document use cases/gameplay, the object model using a UML class diagram and the communication between components with sequence diagrams.
