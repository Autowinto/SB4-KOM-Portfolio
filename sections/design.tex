\section{Design}
The design describes *what* the structure of the system should be to fulfil the requirements.
Document the architecture and abstractions of the system.
Design develops those abstractions into realizable components.
Describe and sketch the *component models* of the game using a UML component diagram.
The component contracts in the system must be described in terms of pre- and post-conditions.
Furthermore, the different elements of the game and how they are connected must be described.
