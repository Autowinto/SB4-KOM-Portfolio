\section{Requirements}
The requirements specifications for this project, are based on the formal requirements of the lab exercises from the course and don't veer too far from the assignment specification.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
The game must be a component- and data-oriented Asteroids game implemented using
the LibGDX Java library. The game must be based on the provided
AsteroidsEntityFramework project in the provided repository\footnote{https://github.com/sweat-tek/SB4-KOM}.
The game must include the components Player, Enemy, Weapon and some sort of Map to play on. The Player, Enemy and
Weapon components must all implement the provided interfaces from the
aforementioned AsteroidsEntityFramework project. If a module is removed from the
game, the game must still function properly, meaning that there must be no hard
dependencies between the different modules and must be independent of eachother.

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
Whenever an asteroid is hit, either by another asteroid or by a player/enemy
bullet, it must split into two smaller asteroids. If the asteroid in question is
already a small asteroid, it should be removed from the world. Likewise with the
enemy and player entites. If either are hit, they should be removed from the
world. The player must be able to be moved around using the arrow keys and be
able to shoot with the spacebar.
