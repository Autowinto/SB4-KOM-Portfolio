\section{Requirements}
The requirements specifications for this project, are based on the formal requirements of
the lab exercises from the course and don't veer too far from 

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

            F01 & The game must include a player component. \\

\subsection{Interfaces}


The Player, Enemy and Weapon components must implement service provided 
interfaces that allow the components to be updated and removed without 
recompilation.
